## Contributing

Workflow Forge is designed to become a community standard for AI workflow automation. We welcome contributions from researchers, engineers, and AI practitioners.

### Current Priority Areas

Under Control by Chris until first working release, though suggestions welcome:

-  **SFCS Implementation** - Flow control compilation logic
-  **TTFA Backend** - GPU tensor operations for autonomous execution

Excellent places for improvement.
- **Community Direction** - What do we want?
-  **Testing & Validation cases** - Particularly in tool usage, about which I know only a bit.
-  **Documentation** - Examples, tutorials, and API docs
- **Research Applications** - Novel use cases and benchmark applications.

### Getting Started
1. Read the [Architecture Overview](docs/Overview.md) to understand the system. 
2. Read the [UDPL Spec](docs/Frontend/UDPL.md) to understand how UDPL and the declaritive syntax works.
3. Read the [SFCS Spec](docs/Frontend/SFCS.md) to understand how flow control works and the common mistakes.
4. Check [open issues](../../issues) for specific tasks
5. Join discussions in [GitHub Discussions](../../discussions) for design questions
