* Outline
  * Greet
  * State purpose
    * Got some cool machine learning stuff including a framework
    * Would love to talk about it to relevant staff; do not really need resources 
    * Would love to get "plugged into science"
  * Possible Details
    * Political: I tend to be unconfident at the political game.
    * Background: Physics undergraduate, then 7 or so years self studying machine learning and training models, a few certificates on and off, but mostly playing around with python and reading papers.
    * Reason: I want to get into machine learning, but I was honestly not sure I was good enough to make it. I did research, usually, useless research, but research nonetheless as practice. Lately, it seems to have ceased to be just practice. I want to get plugged into the network of science. 
    * Have: Workflow forge
      * Nlp prompting framework designed to compile and transmit workflows to a server
      * Once there, they are executed without ever leaving python. In batch
      * Explicitly designed for mass sampling of constitutions 
  * Possible staff and background
    * UW NLP group (who is admin?)
